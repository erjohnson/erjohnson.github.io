Hey, I'm Eric! I'm a technical writer based in Portland, Oregon.

My main interests are documentation, game development, and gamedev tooling.

I use [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) or C/C++ for most of my personal programming projects.

## Currently

- Reading [Dialogue: The Art of Verbal Action for Page, Stage, and Screen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27416067-dialogue)
